	<h1>ActiveInbox</h1>
	<h2>Animation, Web design and development</h2>
    <p>Email is the crux of business communication and it’s easy to become overwhelmed and anxious about keeping track of and missing emails. ActiveInbox was developed to (take line from new copy). By working inside Gmail it’s not another tool you have to install or another process to learn, it’s more like picking up some good habits.</p>
<p>The motivation of ActiveInbox is to free your mind up to be creative and, by actively lowering the amount of time you spend in your inbox, allow you to spend that time doing better things. Working on those big ideas, taking the dog for an extra walk, spending time with family and friends.</p>
<p>I had the pleasure of working with the ActiveInbox team during their new rebrand. The rebrand spanned across the UX and UI of the product as well as deeper level refinement in articulating what they’re trying to achieve. I developed the new website from the designs made by <a href="#">Olly Thomas</a> and continue to work with them developing animations that help visualise the, sometimes abstract, benefits of the app.</p>
