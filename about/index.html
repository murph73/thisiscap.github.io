    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>I’m a graphic designer, currently living in Brighton. As a designer I aim for simple solutions to help people communicate and connect with audiences in meaningful ways.</p>
    <p>To do this I need a keen insight and understanding of your company, products and brand. So all my projects start with an informal chat about what you would like to achieve. To read more about how I work have a look at <a href="/services">what I can do for you</a>.</p>
    <p>I enjoy working with people who are excited about what they make/do and care about what you do. If that sounds like you and you’re interested in working together please please <a href="mailto:hello@christopherporter.co.uk">get in touch</a>.</p>
    <h2>Why sustainability?</h2>
    <p>Nullam quis risus eget urna mollis ornare vel eu leo. Integer posuere erat a ante venenatis dapibus posuere velit aliquet. Duis mollis, est non commodo luctus, nisi erat porttitor ligula, eget lacinia odio sem nec elit. Vestibulum id ligula porta felis euismod semper.</p>
