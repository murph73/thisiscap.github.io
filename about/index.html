    <p>I’m a graphic designer, currently living in Brighton. As a designer I strive for simple solutions to help others communicate and connect with audiences in meaningful ways.</p>
    <p>All my projects start with an informal chat about what you would like to achieve. To learn more about how I work, have a look at <a href="/services">what I can do for you</a>.</p>
    <p>I enjoy working with people who are excited about what they make or do and share interests in sustainability. If that sounds like you and you would like to work together <a href="mailto:hello@christopherporter.co.uk">let me know</a>.</p>

    <p>I share and occasionally write on <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/chrisporterdesigner">LinkedIn</a>. For bits &amp; pieces I made, see or do I use <a href="https://chrisporters.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>. This site, and others, can be seen on my <a href="https://github.com/thisiscap">Github</a>.</p>
