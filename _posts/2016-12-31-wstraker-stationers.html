<p>W. Straker is a stationers with five generations of experience. Passionate about making their mark and challenging what people expect of a stationery supplies company, they lead multiple sustainable initiatives. Their custom CMS visualises customers carbon footprints and suggests ways in which to lower it, including ordering alternative products from the sustainable ranges they offer. Teaming up with <a href="http://www.rechargecargo.co.uk">ReCharge</a> deliveries, for the local area, are now undertaken by cargo bike. Most recently they have started an <a href="http://www.wstraker.com/planting-trees-in-sussex/">initiative to plant trees in the Sussex countryside</a>.</p> 
<p>To reflect this drive and passion they needed a rebrand. During initial discussions we found that Will had a wealth of ephemera from all the <a href="http://www.wstraker.com/our-heritage/">company's heritage</a>, dating all the way back to 1863. Using this material as a springboard for ideas meant that the rebrand embraced its heritage meaningfully and was in character with the brand ethos. As well as a logo a new site a new site was launched, built on an open CMS to give them full control. The rebrand resulted in a platform to increase reach, conversions and continue their good work.
