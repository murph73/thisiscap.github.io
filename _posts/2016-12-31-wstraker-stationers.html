<p>W. Straker is a stationers with five generations of experience. Theyâ€™re passionate about making their mark and challenging what people expect of a stationery supplies company. With a position in the community and chamber of commerce they lead several innovative initiatives for sustainable living. Their custom CMS visualises customers carbon footprint and suggests ways in which to lower it, to order alternative products from the more sustainable ranges they offer. Teaming up with ReCharge bikes deliveries for the local area are undertaken on cargo bikes. Most recently they have started an initiative to plant trees in the Sussex countryside.</p> 
<p>To reflect this drive and passion the brand needed a new direction. Through initial discussions we found that Will had a wealth of ephemera from all the company's heritage, dating all the way back to 1863. Using this material as a springboard for ideas meant that the rebrand embraced its heritage and possessed a sense of authority and weight. It was meaningful and honest. It was important not to start from scratch but to refine what there already was. The logo was refreshed and a new site, built on an open CMS to give them full control, was launched. The rebrand was a great success resulting in a platform to increase reach, conversions and continue the good work.</p>
