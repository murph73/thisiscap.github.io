<p><a href="http://www.wstraker.com">W. Straker</a> is a stationers with five generations of experience. Passionate about making their mark, and challenging what people expect of a stationery supplies company, they lead multiple sustainable initiatives.</p>

<p>Teaming up with <a href="http://www.rechargecargo.co.uk">ReCharge bikes</a>, deliveries to the local area are now undertaken by cargo bike, and most recently they have started an <a href="http://www.wstraker.com/planting-trees-in-sussex/">initiative to plant trees in the Sussex countryside</a>. The challenge was to make their brand reflect this drive and passion.</p>

<h4>Branding</h4>

<p>During initial discussions we found that Will had a wealth of ephemera from all the <a href="http://www.wstraker.com/our-heritage/">company's heritage</a>, dating all the way back to 1863.</p>

<p>Using this material as a springboard for ideas ensured that the rebrand embraced its heritage meaningfully and was in character with the brand ethos. A new logo and wordmark were created that work to convey the brand values.</p>

<h4>Website</h4>

<p>A new site was launched as a platform to inform and introduce to new clients. Built on an open CMS, designed in mind to give them the functionalty to control the site and future updates. The new site continues to act as a platform to increase reach, conversions and continue their good work.</p>

<h4>Reports</h4>

<p>W. Straker deliver reports to customers using data collected through their bespoke ordering system. Their custom CMS visualises customers carbon footprints and suggests ways in which to lower it, including ordering alternative products from the sustainable ranges they offer.</p>
