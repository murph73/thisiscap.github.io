<p><a href="http://secondhelping.co.uk">Second Helping</a> makes it easy to get quality, organic baby food, delivered to your doorstep.</p>

<p>What sets them apart from others, is their pledge to match every subscription with a donation of the same high quality baby food to national food banks.</p>

<p>A new venture, testing the waters for interest, this project wasn't the time for a full branding exercise. It was important though to establish, if only top line, a visual language.</p>

<h4>Website</h4>

<p>The importance of measurement and exposure lent itself to <a href="https://www.launchrock.com">Launchrock</a>, a platform dedicated to early customer acquisition.</p>

<p>The bespoke design was applied to the Launchrock campaign to make use of its tools, while maintaining a high level of control over the site.</p>

<h4>Campaign visuals</h4>

<p>Working with strategist <a href="http://johngraham.co">John Graham</a> we put together a variety of creative for Second Helping awareness campaigns.</p>
