    <p>Email is the bedrock of business communication and it’s easy to become overwhelmed and anxious about keeping track of everything. ActiveInbox brings task management to where tasks originate, your inbox. Working within Gmail it’s not another tool you have to install and learn only to still use email. </p>
    <p>The motivation behind ActiveInbox is to free your mind up to be creative and, by actively lowering the amount of time you spend in your inbox, spend time on what matters. Work on those big ideas, make time for charity, spend time with friends and family. </p>
    <p>I worked with the ActiveInbox team during their recent brand development. The development spanned across the UX and UI of the product as well as deeper level refinement of purpose and articulating what they’re trying to achieve. I developed the new website, from the designs made by <a href="http://www.ollythomas-designs.com">Olly Thomas</a>, and produced a series of illustrations and animations.</p>
