<p>Email is the bedrock of business communication and it’s easy to become overwhelmed and anxious about keeping track of everything. ActiveInbox brings task management to where tasks originate, your inbox. Working within Gmail it’s not another tool or app you need to run alongside email.</p>
<p>The motivation behind ActiveInbox is to free your mind up to be creative and, by actively lowering the amount of time you spend in your inbox, spend time on what matters. Work on those big ideas, make time for charity, spend time with friends and family.</p>
<p>Their recent brand development spanned across the UX and UI of the product as well as deeper level refinement of their communication. I developed the new website, from designs made by <a href="http://www.ollythomas-designs.com">Olly Thomas</a>, and illustrations seen throughout.</p>
