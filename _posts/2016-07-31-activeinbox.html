<p>Email is the bedrock of business communication and itâ€™s easy to become overwhelmed and anxious about keeping track of everything.</p>

<p>The motivation behind <a href="http://activeinboxhq.com">ActiveInbox</a> is to help you take control of your email, so you spend less time searching, worrying and forgetting in your inbox. Freeing your time to spend on what matters to you. To work on those big ideas, make time for charity or spend with friends and family.</p>

<p>Their brand development spanned across the product, internal and external communications.</p>

<h4>Website</h4>

<p>I developed the new website, from designs made by product designer <a href="http://www.ollythomas-designs.com">Olly Thomas</a>.</p>

<h4>Illustration</h4>

<p>Communicating abstract and complex ideas in digestible and accessible ways was a challenge for ActiveInbox. Together we built an illustrative language that reflects the inclusive nature of the company, as well being suitable to explain complex ideas easily.</p>

<p>Illustration was primarily used on the site to describe the product benefits. Later it was applied further to other touch points including newsletters, promotional media and across the onboarding process.</p>

<h4>Animation</h4>

<p>I worked alongside the ActiveInbox team to create an animation to introduce and showcase the product to potential users.</p>

<h4>Overall</h4>

<p>Working with the ActiveInbox team and enjoying the success of the project was a great experience.</p>
