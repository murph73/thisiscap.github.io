    <h2>How I work</h2>
    <p>All my projects start with an informal chat about what you would like to achieve. Afterwards I like to run a small workshop. The design process is collaborative and this workshop gives you the opportunity to tell me all there is to know about your product, service and sector. I especially like to hear about the struggles, triumphs and insights you've come across. This way of working results in thoughtful and bespoke solutions that express your beliefs and values.</p>
